# BranchClone

Branch had been one of the leading Mobile apps that gave soft loans to people in Kenya before the Covid-19 Pandemic. The branch mobile app has a very sleek and simple User Interface that can be used for practice for someone learning mobile app development. Since there are not many Xamarin Developers I know, I decided to do a clone of this app and share the code to enable any upcoming Xamarin forms mobile app dev to learn from this and a professional developer also can correct me where need be.

Below is a sample run-through of how the clone looks like.
